                <h2 class="section-subheading">Sensory Realms</h2>
                    <p>Sensory Realms is a fantasy MMORPG that immerses players in a universe teetering on the brink of war, where each choice defines the course of their journey. Players create unique super-powered beings, each with heightened abilities in touch, sight, or smellâ€”powers that shape their experience and interactions within the game. The faction you align with determines your character's abilities and power-tree, offering deep customization and strategic gameplay.<br>The concept for Sensory Realms was born from a desire to explore how sensory enhancements could create a more immersive and personalized gaming experience. Developing this project involved extensive world-building, intricate power balancing, and designing a dynamic character creation system that allows for diverse gameplay paths. This project pushed the boundaries of my creativity and technical skills, resulting in a rich, multifaceted game world that challenges players to fully engage with their chosen senses.</p>
